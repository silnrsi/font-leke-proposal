FONTLOG
Leke Proposal
=============

This file provides detailed information on the Leke Proposal font.
This information should be distributed along with the Doulos SIL font and
any derivative works.

## About this project

The goal of this project is to produce a provisional font for use in
preparing a Unicode proposal for the Leke script. The font produced
should not be used for other purposes or as a source for other fonts,
as the codepoints are only temporary and the character support is very
limited.

## ChangeLog

### 13 Feb 2025 (SIL WSTech team) Leke Proposal version 1.000
- First release of updated font

### 2027 (SIL MSEAG) Leke 0.63
- Temporary font for language and script research and testing

## Information for developers and contributors

We welcome other developers who wish to get involved in supporting and
enhancing these fonts or who want to modify them. However, the current project
is not intended to produce fonts for general use.

SILâ€™s fonts are licensed according to the terms of the SIL Open Font License
(https://openfontlicense.org). The OFL allows the fonts to be used, studied,
modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves.
