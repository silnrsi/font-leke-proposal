# Leke Proposal

## Project status [![Build Status](http://build.palaso.org/app/rest/builds/buildType:Fonts_LekeProposal/statusIcon)](http://build.palaso.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Fonts_LekeProposal&guest=1)  

The goal of this project is to produce a provisional font for use in preparing a Unicode proposal for the Leke script. The font produced should not be used for other purposes or as a source for other fonts, as the codepoints are only temporary and the character support is very limited.
